    <p The fable about the tester and Newton's Third Law

Morpheus night. You're a big deal
The tester goes out onto the balcony,
In the desire to destroy something
He raises his eyes to the moon.

By the diligence of a worthwhile programmer
It carries a different purpose in itself,
It's not raw Windows Vista here,
A simpleton won't find a bug here.

Newton's law, remembering the third,
Pushes the earth away from itself,
Did God take into account in his project
Such cases, creating the world?

After all, if you jump, try your best,
By guiding the Earth away from the Moon,
The pearls of gravity will break
And we will get a mega bug!

Jumping is declared a routine,
The chimes strike the midnight hour,
And the blood runs briskly through my veins,
And the reserve of forces will not run out.

Chu! Crackling, and grinding, and movement
Here is the long-awaited result!
Alas, but under the shade of the trees
The balcony and our tester are lying.

Don't be in a hurry to be sad, reader,
He's alive, even though he fell from a height,
The balcony couldn't stand it, the traitor,
Destroyed daring dreams.

The mind of the hero should be taken up.
The moral of the fable is for people:
You can't compete with the Lord,
But with a programmer, friend-QA.</p>
